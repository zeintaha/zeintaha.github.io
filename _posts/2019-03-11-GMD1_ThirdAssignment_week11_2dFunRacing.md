Main requirements :
-	Create a 2D local multiplayer game OR a 2D mobile game.
-	Use everything you have learned so far (input, physics, audio, animations...).
-	Your game should include a menu and multiple user interface elements.
Starting from the project requirements presented above, team choose a topic, research options, brainstorming content ideas and finally agreed on idea of a 2D racing car mobile game and a name for project, FUN Racing. Project is an endless game where you need to try and dodge as much cars as possible. It doesn’t have and end purpose, it is just a fun way to kill time.
For this idea we research further use a YouTube Unity Racing Game Development Tutorial by Charger Games and use imported car sprites from that project.
Group worked on game design and decide we will have a number of 4 scenes:  Menu, Options, Level1, Tank. Developing scenes assign for each team member Taha work on Menu and Option scene, Mihai game Level1 scene and Gabriel game Tank scene
